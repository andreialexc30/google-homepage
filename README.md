<h1>About the project</h1>
First mini project issued by The Odin Project. A replica of the Google homepage.
<h2>Description</h2>
It's a simple structured replica of the Google homepage. In this case it's in romanian since it's my native language and my browser is set up in romanian.
<h2>Information</h2>
I've used a very simple HTML&CSS structure in order to build the page.
<h2>What I've learned</h2>
This was the first project I did when I started my web developing journey and it was tricky at first. It made me understand how HTML works and how to structure my code better. I also had to do a lot of research for the CSS and how to style the page. It helped me with looking at a design and turning it into a real thing.
